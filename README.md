# Rod-Length-Challenge

As Maya embarked on her home renovation journey, she came across a long, straight iron rod marked from 0 to N. Eager to create the perfect space, she called in a skilled builder who would make K precise cuts along the rod. After each cut, Maya wanted to know the length of the longest remaining piece of the rod. For every cut made at position páµ¢, she needed to determine the maximum length of the pieces left after the i-th cut.
Can you help Maya figure out the longest piece of the rod after each cut?
